# RTTY/AFSK Interface Circuit Description



![Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4x1md/phone_rtty_interface/master/docs/images/reference_01.png)

## Overview

This interface board was designed for experimenting with RTTY, SSTV and other digital modes with my Yaesu FT-817ND transceiver using [DroidRTTY](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wolphi.droidrtty&hl=en) and [DroidSSTV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wolphi.sstv&hl=en) applications on an Android phone.

## Reference Circuits

The idea of this circuit is not new. Many of its variants were published in the internet and the difference between them is relatively small. Usually different versions use different transistors and diodes and some resistors and capacitors values vary but the circuit remains the same.

One of my sources was the article [An AFSK Interface for Android Smartphones](https://github.com/4x1md/phone_rtty_interface/blob/master/docs/An_AFSK_Interface_for_Android_Smartphones.pdf) by Wolfgang Philips, W8DA, and Martin Huyett, K0BXB, which was published in the May 2012 issue of QST.
