# RTTY/AFSK Interface for Android Phone or Tablet - First Version (Revision A)

## Overview

This is the first revision of the RTTY/AFSK interface board. It was fully functional but had room for improvement. This document shows details of the first revision.

The PCBs for this revision were blue only. Thus if you got a blue PCB from me, you have the first revision board.

## Schematic

### PCB Development

The PCB was designed using KiCAD software as a simple two-layer board with through-hole mounted parts.

### Factory-Produced PCB

Solder mask was made blue in order to match the color of the enclosure box.

### Populated PCB

The design uses through hole parts which make PCB assembly quite simple.

### Assembled Device

I have never completed drilling the front and the rear panel of the box, thus the device has never been fully assembled. The second revision has front and rear panels made of PCB, making the assembly process much simpler.

The following photos show that the PCB perfectly fits in the chosen box.
